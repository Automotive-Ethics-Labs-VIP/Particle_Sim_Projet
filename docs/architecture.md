# Particle Simulation System - Architecture

## System Overview

The particle simulation system is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns and allows for easy extension and optimization.

## Core Components

### 1. Particle System (`src/particle/`)
- **Particle.h/.cpp**: Individual particle with position, velocity, acceleration, mass
- **ParticleSystem.h/.cpp**: Container managing collections of particles

### 2. Physics Engine (`src/physics/`)
- **PhysicsEngine.h/.cpp**: Handles force application, collision detection, integration
- **Forces.cpp**: Various force implementations (gravity, air resistance, etc.)

### 3. Rendering System (`src/rendering/`)
- **Renderer.h/.cpp**: OpenGL-based 2D visualization
- **Shader.h/.cpp**: Shader program management

### 4. Utility Systems (`src/utils/`)
- **JSONExporter.h/.cpp**: Data export for ML training and analysis
- **PerformanceProfiler.h/.cpp**: Performance monitoring and optimization

## Data Flow

```
1. Particle Creation → ParticleSystem
2. Physics Update → PhysicsEngine applies forces
3. Integration → Particles update positions/velocities
4. Collision Detection → PhysicsEngine resolves collisions
5. Rendering → Renderer draws particles to screen
6. Data Export → JSONExporter captures state for analysis
7. Performance Monitoring → PerformanceProfiler tracks metrics
```

## Performance Optimization

### Spatial Partitioning (Future)
- QuadTree implementation for O(n log n) collision detection
- Spatial hashing for broad-phase collision culling

### Memory Management
- Object pooling for particle allocation
- Cache-friendly data layouts
- Minimal memory allocations in main loop

### Rendering Optimization
- Batch rendering for multiple particles
- GPU-based particle systems (future extension)
- Level-of-detail systems for large particle counts

## Integration Points

### Team A (Machine Learning) Integration
- JSON data export provides training data
- Real-time API endpoints for ML model integration
- Standardized data format for decision making

### Performance Targets
- 60+ FPS with 1000+ particles
- <50ms response time for external API calls
- >100MB/hour data generation rate
- Sub-millisecond collision detection with optimization

## Extension Points

1. **New Force Types**: Add to PhysicsEngine force application
2. **Custom Renderers**: Implement new visualization modes
3. **Data Formats**: Extend JSONExporter for different output formats
4. **Optimization Techniques**: Add new spatial data structures
5. **Interactive Elements**: User input handling and real-time control
